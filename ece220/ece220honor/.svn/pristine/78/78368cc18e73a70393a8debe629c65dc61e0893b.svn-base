tests we should do...

a[i++]++
shortcutting


variable offsets assumed to fit in 5-bit 2's complement [-16,15]


IF: both then and else are (possibly empty) statement lists; no real
need to optimize

FOR: init and update are POP_STACK's

RETURN: our version of C has NO IMPLICIT RETURN STATEMENT, so you will
get garbage (probably a 0) if you don't put a return in your C program;
___should the skeleton put something other than 0?


comparisons...

a  < b   is NOT equivalent to a - b < 0 !!!

x4000 < x8000 (no), but x4000 - x8000 = xC000 < 0 !

so... we let them ignore overflows in a-b, presumably?
