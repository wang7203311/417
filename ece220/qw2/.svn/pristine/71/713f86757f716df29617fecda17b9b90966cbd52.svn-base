// should be NULL, and next is used to form the list.   
// 
// The shared list consists of groups with non-empty start and end 
// vertex intersections.  Only one of the requests in the group is in 
// the list.  The others are linked through the first's partner field 
// and then through the next field of the others in the group.  The 
// next field of the first request in a group is used to form the
// shared list.
//
// Note: for MP2, you should only build groups of two in the shared
// list.
